# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 27, 2021 
##### (instead of New Year's resolutions)

**Today's Progress**: Forked repo from [kallaway/100-days-of-code](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code), and started this journey, solved the LeetCode problem in Javascript

**Thoughts:** I have always wanted to try this challenge. Why not today?
